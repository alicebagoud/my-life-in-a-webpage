                    <p><em>Tournus</em> is the village I was born in. It has a big river called <em>La Saône</em>, a beautiful Cathedral and great sunsets. <br /> It is located in one a the best wine regions called <em>La Bourgogne</em>.</p>

                    <p>Australia is an incredible country. I has so many beautiful views and people are really nice. <br/> I lived in Brisbane and Melbourne and also visited Sydney.</p>

                    <img src="imgs/guatape.jpeg" alt="Guatapé"/>
                    <p>It was really hard to choose a picture for this one. I have so many and this country is sooo beautiful. <br /> Guatapé is a little town in Antioquia near Medellin. <br /> It has many many colors and a big big stone you can climb and walk up. It has many little islands you can see from the top of the stone. I visited it in March, this year. <br /> I really recommend this country to visit, it is for me the best country in the world hahaha.</p>

                    <p>The best city in France. I lived there 7 years and don't regret one single moment. It is an incredible city for kids, students, adults and in all kind of seasons, <em>The Alpes</em> in winter and many places and lakes in summer such as <em>Annecy</em> or <em>Aiguebelette.</em></p>
